### Lesson 2: Variables and Data Types

#### Objectives
- Learn to store and manage data in JavaScript.

#### Code Example
```javascript
let name = "Alex";
let age = 10;
let favoriteColor = "blue";

console.log("Hi, I am " + name + ". I am " + age + " years old, and I love the color " + favoriteColor + ".");
```

#### Exercise
- Create variables for your name, age, and favorite color. Print a sentence using these variables.

**Example Solution:**
```javascript
let name = "Jamie";
let age = 12;
let favoriteColor = "green";
console.log("Hello! I am " + name + ". I am " + age + " years old, and my favorite color is " + favoriteColor + ".");
```
